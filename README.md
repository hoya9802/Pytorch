# Pytorch

## It is a repository that stores and records PyTorch codes for deep learning!<br>
 - Pytorch_Basic : Code for the basic functions of PyTorch. (if you've already known Numpy, it would be easy)<br> 
 - Simple_NN : Code for the basic functions of nn.Linear(). Implementing code to make simple model using class, obtain model parameters<br>
 - Binary_Classification : Implementation of simple binary tesk using simple data made by torch.randn() function
